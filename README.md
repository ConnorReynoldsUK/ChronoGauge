# ChronoGauge ensemble

## Overview
ChronoGauge is a bagging-like ensemble model for circadian time (CT) estimation from transcriptome samples (e.g. RNA-seq, microarray).

ChronoGauge is trained using Arabidopsis RNA-seq data and has been applied across various contexts including:
* Testing hypotheses related to the circadian clock in RNA-seq data
* Microarray samples
* Non-model species using gene orthologs


## Dependencies
Scripts use the following:
* Python v3.9.5
* tensorflow==2.6
* scikit-learn==0.24.2
